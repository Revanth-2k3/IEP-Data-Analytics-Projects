2) HR Employee Attrition

Objective: This project focuses on Employee Attrition Prediction using a dataset of employees. The goal is to analyze attrition trends, preprocess the data, and prepare it for machine learning models.

Preprocessing Steps:

Dropped Irrelevant Columns (e.g., EmployeeCount, StandardHours, Over18, EmployeeNumber).

Encoded Categorical Variables using one-hot encoding.

Converted Attrition to Binary (Yes → 1, No → 0).

Checked and Handled Missing Values (No missing values found).

Scaled Numerical Features using StandardScaler.

Split Data into 80% training and 20% testing for machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed attrition trends based on salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance, promotions, and tenure.

Visualized attrition rates with Seaborn (boxplots, heatmaps, and count plots).

Identified correlations between employee features and attrition.

Dataset:

The dataset (HR-Employee-Attrition.csv) contains various features related to employees, such as age, job role, salary, work-life balance, and attrition status.
